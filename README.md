# Unlucky Ladybugs

## Project Overview

This project is part of the FEND Program via Udacity.  The goal of the project was to create a game using HTML5 Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript that was similar in function to the classic arcade game known as Frogger.  Game play is straighforward - your player must cross the length of the game canvas and not collide with the enemy bugs.  If your player reaches the end of the canvas without colliding with an enemy, you win that round and will gain one win for that play.  Any collision with an ememy and that round is over and win points are not rewarded.  You control your player using the left, right, up and down arrow keys on your keyboard and can move in those directions block by block in the canvas space.
